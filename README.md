# Number-Guessing-Game

The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to
guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.

2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.

3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is
higher/lower than the generated number.

4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.

**You can also incorporate further details as:**

> Limiting the number of attempts.

> Adding more rounds.

> Displaying score.

> Giving points based on the number of attempts.

## Brief overview of my project:

I joined an internship program and worked on a couple of projects like this project. Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish 
it due to unexpected circumstances, but I really enjoyed the experience. I hope to work on 
similar projects in the future!

**Disclaimer:** I had some form of help making this project.
